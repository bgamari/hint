Feel free to open an issue or a PR, but please don't be upset if it lingers for
a long time. While hint does have a few contributors (the most active
contributor is listed as the maintainer), we are all busy with other projects
and none of us wants hint to be among their primary responsibilities. So the
best way you could contribute would be by becoming the new maintainer :)
